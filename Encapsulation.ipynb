    "## Encapsulation is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that means bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that work on the data into a single unit (a class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's data, which helps protect the data and makes the class easier to use and maintain."

    "# Key Features of Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Hiding: By using private or protected attributes, encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from outside interference. This prevents external functions or objects from directly modifying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlled Access: With encapsulation, you can provide getter and setter methods to control how the internal data is accessed or modified. This ensures that changes to the objectâ€™s data follow specific rules or validations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modularity: It makes the code modular by dividing the program into distinct classes, each handling its own data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security: By restricting direct access to some components, encapsulation enhances security by protecting sensitive data from unwanted changes."

    "## 1. ATM Machine:\n",
    "## Encapsulation Concept: The user interacts with an ATM machine to withdraw money, check balance, or deposit funds. However, the internal workings, such as verifying the account, checking available balance, and transaction processes, are hidden from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works: The user interface provides controlled access to perform specific actions without exposing sensitive data, ensuring security and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefit: Users don't need to know how the internal system works; they only interact with the provided interface, ensuring simplicity and data protection."

However, the backend logic that handles record storage, validation, and retrieval is hidden from the end-users (doctors, nurses, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works: The system encapsulates sensitive patient data and only exposes essential features like viewing or updating records through specific functions. Access to underlying data (like server databases) is restricted to maintain data privacy and security.\n",
